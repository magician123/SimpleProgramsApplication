Coding Program (EvenNumberEvaluator)
-	Create a program that checks if a given number is even or odd.
o	Given the number 2, the program should print out ”This number is Even”
o	Given the number 3, the program should print out “ This number is Odd”	

Coding Program (Binary Triangle)
-	Create a program that prints a binary triangle
-	Enter the Number of Rows : 5
1
01
010
1010
10101

Coding Program (Palindrome)
-	Write a program that tells if a given string is a Palindrome or not
o	Given a string dad, The program should print out “Palindrome”
o	Given a string father, The program should print out “Not a Palindrom
o	e”

Coding Program (Sort)
-	Write a program in C# Sharp to sort elements of array in ascending order
Test Data :
Input the size of array : 5
Input 5 elements in the array :
element - 0 : 2
element - 1 : 7
element - 2 : 4
element - 3 : 5
element - 4 : 9
Expected Output :
Elements of array in sorted ascending order:
2 4 5 7 9




Coding Program (Max Number)
	Write a program that takes a list of x numbers and returns the Maximum number 
o	Given 23,56,2,34,5,8,9,12,56,99
o	Expected output = 99
Coding Program (ReverseString)
-	Write a program that takes a given string and reverse it
o	Given Hello, output = olleh
o	Given world,  Output = dlrow

Coding Program (Factorial)
-	Write a factorial program that prints the factorial of a given number
o	Input 6
o	Output: The Factorial of 6 is 720
Coding Program (Statistics)
-	Write a program that takes x-numbers numbers as input and find the smallest number
o	Input 2,3,4,5
o	Output smallest = 2

Coding Program (Occurrence)
-	Count the occurrence of each character in a string
o	Input: Hello World
o	Output:
  h – 1
  e – 1
  l – 3
  o – 2
  w – 1
  r – 1
  d – 1

Coding Program (DuplicateCharacters)
-	Write a program that takes a string and removes all the duplicate characters in that string
o	Input: Tshepiso Marape
o	Output: TshepioMar

Coding Program (FibonacciSeries)
-	Print out a Fibonacci series
o	Output: Enter the number of elements: 15
0	1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 , 610, 987
 

Coding Program (PrimeNumber)
-	Check if a given number is a prime number or not
o	A Prime Number is a number which should be greater than 1 and it only is divided by 1 and itself. In other words, we can say that the prime numbers can’t be divided by other numbers than itself and 1. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23…., are the prime number
o	Enter a Number : 19
o	True 
Coding Program (ValidInputString)
-	Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

o	An input string is valid if:
	Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
	Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
 

-	Example 1:
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: s = "([)]"
Output: false
Example 5:

Input: s = "{[]}"
Output: true

Coding Program (HappyNumber)
-	Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".
o	A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

o	Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.

o	Example: 
o	Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

Coding Program (Reverver Each Word In A Given String)
-	Write a program that reverse each word individually without changing its position in the string.
o	Example: Welcome to the game
o	Output: emocleW ot eht emag
